# RIME: Recursive Inference Model Engine

**RIME** is an adaptive, self-evolving reasoning architecture designed to model nested frames of belief, contradiction, and adaptation. Unlike traditional AI systems, RIME does not start with a fixed definition of truth‚Äîit constructs its belief system from the bottom up, through repeated interaction with data and persistent contradictions.

> Truth is not defined from the top-down, but earned from the bottom-up through contradiction and adaptation.

## üîç AI Challenges Solved by This Architecture

This system addresses foundational limitations in traditional AI through a modular, adaptive, contradiction-driven reasoning engine.

| **Challenge**                   | **Traditional AI Struggles With...**     | **RIME's Approach**                                        |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Symbolic Brittleness**     | Crashes or halts when contradictions arise | Absorbs contradictions into adaptive belief structures      |
| **Grounding Problem**        | Symbols lack real-world experiential link  | Builds truth empirically through repeated input patterns    |
| **Catastrophic Forgetting**  | Overwrites old knowledge with new          | Isolates beliefs in evolving, competing frames              |
| **Training Data Bias**       | Locked into initial dataset assumptions    | Continuously learns from new, live data                     |
| **Black-box Inference**      | Decisions lack transparency                | Traceable logic with trust scores and contradiction history |
| **Single-model Fragility**   | One-model failures cause total breakdown   | Maintains multiple competing, mergeable belief frames       |
| **Closed-world Assumption**  | Fails on unseen or unknown inputs          | Welcomes novelty; defines truth through persistence         |

> üí° Truth is not imposed ‚Äî it emerges through tension with experience.

## üöÄ Features

- **Contradiction-Driven Adaptation**: Frames learn by identifying and incorporating repeated contradictions.
- **Multi-Frame Reasoning**: Competing frames allow different belief systems to coexist and evolve.
- **Frame Merging & Pruning**: Redundant or weak frames are merged or discarded automatically.
- **Trust-Based Logic**: Inputs raise or lower their trust value over time, influencing belief formation.
- **Persistent State**: System state is saved to and restored from disk using JSON.
- **Full Audit Trail**: Every change is recorded for traceability and explanation.

## üß† Core Concepts

### üß± Frame (Local Unit)

* Maintains its own logic (axioms).
* Adapts by contradiction or confirmation accumulation.
* Learns by recursively restructuring based on input patterns.

### üß† MetaFrameManager (Global Coordinator)

* Selects active frame based on lowest contradiction.
* Spawns new frames when existing ones don't fit.
* Merges frames when they become too similar.
* Tracks long-term abstract patterns and system events.

## üîß Architecture Overview

### üß± Individual Frame Unit

Each **Frame** is an isolated logical entity that:

* Accumulates and revises **axioms** (truths).
* Tracks **contradictions** and **trust** in inputs.
* Evolves autonomously through **adaptation**.

#### Frame Components

| Component        | Description                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `axioms`         | Current accepted truths or beliefs.                   |
| `trust`          | Confidence weights for input patterns.                |
| `contradictions` | Inputs recently found to be inconsistent with axioms. |
| `history`        | Log of structural changes (e.g. adaptation events).   |
| `events`         | Timeline of all evaluations (accept/reject outcomes). |

#### Frame Functions

| Function     | Description                                                           |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `evaluate()` | Tests an input against axioms, adjusts trust, logs result.            |
| `adapt()`    | Converts contradictions into new axioms when a threshold is exceeded. |
| `score()`    | Returns the frame's fitness as `axioms - contradictions`.             |

#### Frame Behavior

* First two inputs define the notion of consistency.
* Contradictions can later become accepted truths via `adapt()`.
* Trust decays for frequently contradicted inputs.

## üîÅ Important Aspects

1. **Inputs** are read from `INPUT_data.csv`
2. **Frames** evaluate these inputs based on their current axioms.
3. **Contradictions** cause frames to adapt and evolve.
4. **MetaFrameManager** tracks the best-fit frame and manages transitions.
5. **State** is persisted to `rime_state.json` after every run.
6. **Outputs** are written to CSV files for analysis and auditability.
7. Input can be run indefinately without needing to retain past inputs.
8. Can be run and trained in real-time.

## üìå Notes

* Designed to be fully cross-platform.
* Uses only local files, no external dependencies beyond standard Python + matplotlib + networkx.
* Extensible to real-time input streams or symbolic abstraction layers.

## üß† Philosophy

RIME is not a model of truth ‚Äî it's a model of belief adaptation. It does not assume correctness. It builds coherence by interacting with contradiction.
> "Truth is not what is imposed ‚Äî it is what survives contradiction."
